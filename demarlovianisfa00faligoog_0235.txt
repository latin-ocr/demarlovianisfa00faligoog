He had aleoe aplayer boene
Upon the Camino-stage,

But brake his legin one lewd scene,
When in his early age.

He was a follow to all those
That did God’s laws reject,
Consorting with the Christians’ foas
And men of ill aspect.

Ruffians and cutpurses hee
Hed ever at his backe,

And led a life most fonte and free,
To his eternall wracke.

He now is gone to his account,
And gone before his time,

Did nothis wicked deedes surmount
All precedent of crime.

But he no warning ever tocke
From others' wofull fate,

And never gave his life a looke
Untifl it was to fate.

He had a friend, once gay and greeae,
Who died not long before,

The wofull’st wretch¹ was ever seen,
The worst ere woman bore,

Unlesse this Wormafl did exceede
Even him in wickednesse,

Who died in the extreemest neede
And terror’s bitternesse.

Yet Wormalf ever kept his course,
Since nought could him dismay;
He knew not what thing was remorso

Unto his dying day.

Then had he no time to repent
The crimes he did commit,

And no man ever dit tament
F or him, to dye unfitt.

Ah, how is knowledge wasted quite
On such want wisedome true,

And that which should be guiding li'ght
But leades to errors newet
