Supra retuli responsum ohetteti, qui libellum ediderat, 111ῐῦ-
moniis llarlovii et Shakespeari. Narravi quomodo libello, cujus
auctoritas primum vocata lucrat in dubium, fides deinde
adjuncta sit.

Inter multos scriptores qui rem perpenderunt, 1111, etnisi
fallor, solus omnium, libelli fidem suspectam perseveranter
babuit. llle quidem Paynus est Collierus‚ qui scientia excellenti
singularique et judicio firmo subtilique nituit. Ex armalium
vetustate memoriam eorum qui fabulas in scenam inducere
coeperunt primus eruit, et tanto cum studio ad hanc indaga-
tionem animum intendit, ut abhinc nil magni momenti et
ponderis rebus quas invenit additum sit, quamvis 11 1111 rebus
mendae quaedam notatae luerint. Caute quid sentiret exposuit,
verbis autem quibus significat rem quam in dubium vocaverat
in animo suo proxime ad certum deductam fuisse.

thern with your admired 1111111111. l know the 1111 husband 11 you all will
never prove an Usurer, and the kindest 11 them all wil never proove a kinde
⁴ nurse: yet, whilst you may, seeke you better ltlaisters3 111 itis pittiemen oi
such rare wits, should be subject to the pleasures 11 such rude groomes.

1 11 11111 might insert two more, that both have writ against these buckrarn
Gentlemen: but let their owne works serve to witnesse against their owne
wickednesse, 11 they persever to maintaine any more such peasants. For other
new commers, l 11111 them to the 1111111 11 11111 painted monsters, who (l doubt
not) will drive the best minded 1ο despise them: 111 111 1111, 11 111111 111
though they make 1 jeast at them.

«But now returnel againe 'to you three, knowing my miserie 11 11 you no
news; and let me heartily intreate you to 111 warned by my hermes. Delight
not (as 1 have done) in irreligione oaths3 111, 11111111 blasphemers house, 1
curse shall not deperi. Despise drunkennes, which wasteth the wit, aud maketh
1111111 equal unto beasts. Flie lust, 11 111 (1111111111 11 111 11111, and desile
not the Temple 11111 holy ghost. Abhorre those Epicures, whose looselife 1111
made religion lothsome to your eares; and when they sooth you with tearmes
oi Meistership‚ remember Robert Greene, whome they have often so ssattered,
perishes now 111 want os 11111111. Remember, gentlemen, your lives are like so
many lighted Tapers, that are with care delivered to all oi you to maintaine: these
with wind-pust wrath may be extinguisht, which drunkennes put out, which
negligente let fall: ior mans 11111 1111 11111 11 111 11 short, but 111111111
shortened by sin. Γ111 111 11 my light 11 now 11 111 last 111111, and the want
ol wherwith to sustaine it; there is no substance leit 111 1111 11 foede on. Trust
1111111 (l beseech yee) to such weake staies ε 111 they are as changeable in
minde, as in many attires. 1111111, my hand is tired, and l am 11111 11 leave
where 1 would begin3 111 1 whole boohe cannot containe their wrongs, which
l am 1111111 knit up in some 1111111111 words.

1 Desirous that you should live, though himselie be dying.
