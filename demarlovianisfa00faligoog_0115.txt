Buzzeel an Epitaph into my hed.

Magnifique Mindes bred of Gergantuas rece

ln grisly weedes His Obsequies waiment (sie)
Wh0s000rps0n1>0wles‚ whose mind triumph'd on Kent‚
Seorning to bete Sir Rodomont en ace.

I mus'd awhile, and, haulay mus'd awhile,

lese (qeothl) is that Gargentua minde
Conquered and lest no Scanderbeg behinde?
Wowecl he not to Powles a second bilet

What bile or hibe? (qeolh that same early spriyht)
Have you terget the Scanderbegging wight.

GLOSSE

Is it a Dreemet or is the Highest minde

That ever haented Powles or hunted winde

Bereasl os that same shy-sermountinq breath,

That breath that taught the Tempany to swell?

He and the Plagae contended sor the yeme:

The hawty man extolles his hideous thoughtes,

And gloriously insultes upon poore soules

Thac plagae themselves: for taint harts plague themselves.

The tyrant Siehness os base minded slaves

Oh how it dominer’s in Coward Lane!

So Susquidy ranq eet his larum hnell

When he had qirn’d et many a dolesall bell.

The yraend Dlsease disdain'd his Toaele Coneeil

And smilin9 at his Tamberlaine contempt

Sternly struck home the peremptory stroke.

He that norseared God nor· dreadecl Dle’ll,

Nor· ought admirecl but his wondrous selse

Lihe lenos yawcly Bird that proudly stares

On glittrinq fan of his triumphant telle,

Or like the uyly Buyy that seorn'd to dy,

Aeclmoantes os Glory rear’d in toweriny wilt. ·
, Ales! but Babell Pride must kiss the pitt.

Beware the next Bell-beggar'os the totone.
