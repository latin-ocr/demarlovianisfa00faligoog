tut of these determinatione, it is possible to make or to selecta ,
ypioal line, the normal line of English heroic rhythm. nno ior this
purpose we can do no better than choose tha one indicated by Johnson
from Milton:

‹ Love lights his lamp, and waves his purple wing. »

‹ Here it will be noticed we get five accents regularly falling on ·
the second syllable of each soot, and a panse marked at the end oi the
fourth syllable. Such a line may be termed the ideal line oi English
heroic prosody ; and it is our business to keep its scheme some·
where, in however shadowy a shape‚ present to our mind, in order
to appreciata and judge the almost innumerable declensions from the
type, which constitute the variety and beauty of the metro in the
handling of great masters ¹. ι

Hic versus, qui metrum iactus est praecipuum, et, ut ita dicam,
classique gravis sublimisque poesis apud Britannos prioribus tem-
poribus jam in consuetudinem scriptorum venerat etcum linguae

natura mire consentiebat. Redactus autem iuerat in verborum simi- “

liter desinentium servitutem usque ad tempora Surreii qui illume
vinculis istis exemit quum AEneidos excerpta in britannicam linguam
transtulit. Attamen a Surrcii temporibus usque ad Marlovianam
aetatem non ex libertate recepta capti lucrant fructus qui percipiendi
essent. Litteris eruditi, versus non similiterdesinentescomponendo,
hos legi adstringebant non soni, sed numeri usurpati a poetis graecis
qui carmina scripserunt heroica, qua' lege versus illi deformabantur
et non valebant ad vim et sensus poetarum exprimendum.

‹ The cultivated poets who first employed this unrhymed verse,
were 'struck with the similarity it offered to the lambio measure oi
the ancients. Having studied prosody in Greek and Latin metreS,
they applied the classical nomenclatore os quantitative scansion to
English rhythms. At the same time they overlooked this important ,
circumstance, that the heroic line lell short oi the Greek senarius by
one whole soot ². ι

‹ Starting with the notion that the heroic line was what an old
critic has called it, ‹ alicenciate iambic, ι the first writers of blank
verse took pains to imitate the iambic rhythm as closely as possible
by alternating an unaccented with an accentad syllable throughout

the line· This process led them to end the line with a strong mono-
syllable‚ and to isolate each verse. . .. t
