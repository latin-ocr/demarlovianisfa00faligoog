intemperanter autem critici usi sunt indiciis internis lis
cuncta subjecerunt, obliti magnam prudentiam adhibendam
esse in harum rationum usu, et indicia non solum numeranda,
sedetiam, ut dixit Jacobus Darmstetter, ponderanda esse.
Attamen, quum hic modus in re tenetur, indicia illa prodesse
possunt ¹.

Quaesitum est primurn num Shakespearus in totum aut ex
parte quatuor fabulas scripserit?

Cirnctae sententiae ad tres opiniones praecipuas reduci pos·
sunt.

Prima, quam Fleiaus defendit, dicitur Shakespearus nullam
e quatuor fabulis scripsisse.

Secunda, contra, quatuor fabulae in eum conferuntur. Dum
autem alii existimant eum in totum has composuisse, alii cre-
dunt laboris socios ei fuisse.

Tertia putant Shakespearum non scripsisse duas veteres

¹ Eduardus hovedenus (Edward Dowden. - Shakspere: a critical Study of his
hlind and Art. London‚ King, 1875, l vol. iri-8⁰) in sequente loco historiam
harum artium commemoravit:

ι hlr Spedding, in his article a Who wrote llenry Vllli» (Gentleman's hfagazine,
August, 1850) first applied quantitative criticism of verse peculiarities to tha
study of Shakspere’s writings. pp Charles Bathurst, in a hemarks on the
Differenees of Shakespeare’s l'crsifrcation in different Periods of his Lif »
(London, 1857), called attention to the change ι from broken to interrupted
verse» which took place as Shahspere advanced in his dramatis career3 and
observed also the increase in the use of double-endings in his later plays.
Professor Craik‚ in his « English ol Shakespere ι and Professor J. K. Ingram, in
a lecture upon Shahspere published in ι Afternoon Lectures a (Bell and
Daldy,18[i3l, again called attention to these peculiarities of versification as
alfording evidence for the ascertainment of the chronology of the plays.
Finally, about the same time in England and in Germany‚ two investigators-
Rev. F. G. Fleay and Professor Hertzberg - began to apply «quantitative
criticism υ of the characteristics of verse to the determination of the dates of
plays. The test ou which Hertzberg chiefly relies is the feminine (double)
ending3 he gives the pereentage of such endings in seventeen plays, and
believes that the percentage indicates their chronological order. See the
preface to Cymbeline in the German Shakespeare Society’s edition of Tieck's
and Schlegol's translation. hlr Fleay’s results, independently ascertained‚ were
published subsequently to llerzberg's. See Trans. New Shakspere Society
and llfacmllloa'r trapezitae, Sept. tall. ln 1873 llir Furnivall, in founding the
New Shakspere society, - before he was aware that hir Fleay's work was in
progress, - insisted on the importando of metrical tests for determining the
chronology, and gave the proportion of stopt to unstopt lines in three early and
three late plays, The latest contribution to the subject is Professor Ingram's
valuable paper, read before the New Shakspere Society on the rWeaklinding»
