These are the blessings promised to the Jews,

And hersin was old Abram's-happiness :

What more may heaven do for earthly man

Than thus to pour out plenty in their laps,

Ripping the bowels ol the earth for them,

Making the sea[s] their servants, 'rand' the winde¹

To dri've their substance with successful bla'stsl
’ Who hateth me but lor my happiness?

Or who is honoured now but l'or his wealthl

And crowns come either by succession,

Or urged by lorce; and nothing violent,

That thirst so much'lor principality.

But one sole daughter, whom lhold as dear

As Agamemnon did his Iphigen ε ”

And all l have is hers. — But 'vvho comes heret
