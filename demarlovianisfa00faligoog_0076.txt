- a The Printer to the Gentlemen Reddens.

« Gentlcmen, l know you ar not nnacquainted with tho death of
Robert Greene, whose pen in his life-time pleased you as well on the
Stage asin the Stationers shops : And, to speahe truth‚ although his
loose life was odious to God and offensive to men, yet forasmuch as
at his last end ho found it most grievous to himselfe (as appeareth
by this his repentant discourse)‚ Ι doubt not but ho shall for tha
same deservo favour both of God and men...

u For herein appeareth that he was a man given over to the lust
of his owne heart, forsaking all godlines, and one that daily deli-

I trust hee shall hee the better accepted, that by the working of Gods
holy spirit, returnes with such a resolved Repentance, being a¹ thing
acceptable both to God and men.

ungodly waieS, I thought good to publish the same ι and the rather,
for that by his repentance they may as in a glasse see their owne
follie, and thereby in time resolve that it is better to die repentant,

than to live dishonest.
