The Atheist’s Transdie.

This bellad, inquit Dyoius (Mortowe's mortes, p. 387) is printed .
from a manuscript ¹copy in the possession of Mr J. P. Coliion. The
‹ Friend once gay and greene ι is Robert Green03 Wormall is the
anognam of Monlow.

Α11 you that have got eones to heere,
Now listen unto mee;

Whiist 1 do tell a tale of foere ;
A true ono it shall boe :

Α truer stonie nere was told,
As some alive oon showe;

'Tis oia man in crime grown olde‚
Though age he did not know

This man did his owne God denie
And Christ his onelio son,

And did all punishment defle,
’ So he his course might run.

Both day and night would he blaspheme,
And day and night would sweare,

As if his lise was but a disemo,
Not ending in dispeire.

A poet was he of reputo,
And wrote suli many a plays,
. Now strutting in e silhen suto,
Thon beggiog by tho wey.
