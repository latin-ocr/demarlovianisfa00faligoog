ANote contayninge the Opinion ol oue Christoler Marlye, con·
cernyuge his damnable opinions and ludgement ol Relygion ancl
Scorne ol Gods Worde.

F rom. Ms. Harl. 6853, Fol. 320 ¹.

That the lndians and many Authors ol Antiquitei have assuredly
written ο1 above tt thowsande yeers agone, wher Adam is proved
Ι to have leyved within 6 thowsaude years.

He affirmetis That Moyses was but a luggler, and that one
Heriols can do more then hee. ,

That Moyses made the lewes to travell lortie years in the wil·
dernes (which iorny might have ben donin lesse then one yeer) er
they came to the promised lande, lo the intente that those whoe wer
privei to most ol his subtileteis might perish‚ and so an everlastinge
supersticion remayne in the hartes ol the people.

That the lirste beginnynge ol Religion was only to keep men in
awo.

That it was an easye matter lor Moyses beinge brought up in all
, the artosol the Eglptians‚ to abuse the lewes, being a rude and
grosse people.

That he (Christ) was the sonno ol a carpenter, and that, yl the
J ewes amonge whome he was born did crucilye him, thei best knew
him and whence he came.

That Christ deserved better to dye than Barrabas, and that the
Jewes made a good choyce, though Barrabas were both a theile and
a murtherer. ’

¹ This paper, inquit Dycius, (Marlowe’a workes, p. 389), was first printed by
Riison in his observationem Warton's Hist. ef Ε. P„ p. tt...

ln a volume ol Marlowe's collected pieres (now in the Bodleian Library}‚
blalone has written what follows.

«This llichard Bame or Banes was hanged at 'l'yburn or thedth oi Dec.
1591. See the Stationer’s liegister, Book B, p. 316.

ι lt is obvious to remark upon this testimony, that it is not upon ooth,¹ that
it contains some declarations which it is utterly incredible that lilarlowe
should have made [as that concerning his intention to coin¹ which he must have
known to be penal) 3 that Bame does not appear to have been conlronted with
the person accused‚ or cross - examined by him or any other person3 and that
tha whole rests upon his single assertion. 'lhis paper, however, may darive
some support from the verses quoted at the other side (ol the page in Malone's
book) trom the Returne from Parnassus, which was written about l0 years
atter llarlowe’s death. » ’
