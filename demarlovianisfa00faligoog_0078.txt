short time, and driven my self out of credit with sundry ol my
irends, I became an Author of PlayeS, and a penner of Love Pam-
phlets, so that Ι soone grew famous in that qualitie‚ that who lor that
trade growne so ordinary about London as Robin Greene. Yoyguj
yet in yearea though olde in wickednes, l began to resolve that
there was nothing bad that was profitablc: whereupon Ι grew so
rooted in all mischiele, that Ι had as greata delight in wickednesse,

as sundrie heth in godlinesse τ and as much felicitie Ι tocke in
villany as others had in honestie. r Sig. C.

ἀ Yet let me confesse a trueth, that even once, and yet but once, l
felt a feare and horrour in my conscience, and then the terrour of
Gods judgementes did manifestly teach me that my life was bad, that
by sinne I deserved damnation‚ and that such was the greatnes oi
my siuns, that Ι deserved no redemption. And this inward motion l
received in Saint Andrews Church in the Cittie of Norwich, at a

manner, that Ι began to call unto mind the daungerol my seule, and
the prejudice that at length would befall mee fonthose grosse sinnes
which with greedinese Ι daily committed ε in so mueh -as sighingl
said to myselse, Lord have mercie upon mee, and send me grace
to amend and become a new man. But this good motion lasted not
long in mee: for no sooner had‘l met with my copesmate‘s, but
seeing mein suche solemne humour, they demaunded the cause of
my eadnes ι to whom when l had discovered that l sorrowed lor
my wickednesse of lile, and that the Preachers wordes had taken
a deepe impression in my conscience, they lell upon me in jeasling
