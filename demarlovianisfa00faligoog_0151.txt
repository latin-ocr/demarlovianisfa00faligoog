Tomb. Then sit thou down, divine Zenocrate;
And here we crown thee Quaen ol Persia,
And all the kingdoms and dominicus

That late the power ol Tamhurlaine subdued.
As luno, when the giants were suppressed,
That darted mountains al her brother J ove,
So looks my love, shadowing in her brows
Triumphs and trophies lor my victories;

Or, as Latona’s daughters bent to arms,
Adding more courage to my conquering mind.
Το gratily the sweet Zenoorate‚

Egyptians, Moors, and men ol Asia,

From Barbary unto the western ludia,

Shall pay a yearly tribute to thy sire:

And from the hounds os Alrie to the banks

Os Ganges shall his mighty arm extend.

And now, my lords and loving lollowerS,
That purchased kingdoms by your martial deeds‚
Cast off your armour, put ou scarlet robes,
Mount up your royal places ol estate,
Environed with troops os noblemen,

And there make laws to rulo your provinces.
Hang up your weapons on Alcides' post,

For Tamhurlaine takes truce with all the world.
Thy first-betrothed love, Arabia,

Shall we with honour, as heseems entomh
With this great Turk and his sair Emperess.
Then, alter all these solemn exequias,

We will our rites os marriage solemnise ¹.
