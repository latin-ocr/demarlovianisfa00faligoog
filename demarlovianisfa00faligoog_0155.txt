And sooner let the fiery elemeut

Dissolve and make your kingdom in the sky,
Than this base carth should shroud your majesty:
For should Ι but suspect your death by mine,

The comfort of my future happiness,

And hope to meet your highness in the heaveus,
Turned to despair, would break my wretched breast‚
And lury would confouud my present rest.

But let me die, my love; yet let me die ;

With love and patience let your true love diel
Your grief and fury hurts my second lif .

Yet let me kiss my lord before l die,

’ Aud let me die with kissing of my lord.

But since my life is lenghtened yet a while,

Let me take leave of these my leving sons,

And of my lords‚ whose true nobility

Have merited my latest memory.

Sweet sons, farewelll ln death resemble me,

And in your lives your father's excellence.

Some music, and my fit will cesse, my lord-

(Tdey collsor masiel

Tamb. Proud fury, aud intolerable fit,

That dares torment the body of my love,

And scourge the scourge of the immortal God:
Now are those spheres‚ where Cupid used to sit,
Wounding the world with wonder and with love,
Sadly supplied with pale and ghastly death,
Whose darts do pieros the centre of my soul.
Her sacred beauty hath enchanted heaven ;

And had she lived before the siege of Troy,
Helen (whose beauty summoned‘Greece to arms,
And drew a thousand ships to Tenedos)

Had not been named iu Homer’s lliads ;-

Her name had been in every line he wrote.

Or had those wauton poets, for whose birth

Old Rome was proud, but gazed a while on her,
Nor Lesbia nor Corinna· had been named;
Zenocrate had been the argument

Of every epigram or elegy.

(The music sounds. — Zenocrafe dies).

Whatl is she deadf Techelles, draw thy sword
And wound the earth, that it may cleave in twain,
And we descend into the infernal vaults,
