¹licce locus qui ad llarlovium attinet: If woluil experience may meone
you (Gentlemen) to bevere, or unheard ot wretchednes intreate you to take
heed; l doubt not but you will looke hacke with sorrow on your time past,
and endevour with repentance to spend that which is to come. Wonder not,
(ior with thee will l tirst hegin) thou famous gracer oi Tragedians‚ that Grecos,
who hath said with thee, like the scole in his beart, There is no God, should nov
give glorie unto his greatnesse3 ior, penitrating in his power, his hand lies
heavie upon me, he hath spoken unto me witha voice ol thunder, and l have
leit (leit), he is a God that can punish enimies. Why should thy excellent wit,
his gift, be so blinded, that thou shouldst give no glory to the giver‘? ls it pesti-
lent llachivilian pollicie that thou host studiedt Ο punish (peevish) soille! What
are his rules but meere confused mockeries, able to extirpate in small time, the
generation ot mankinde. For il Sic voto, sic judeo, hold in those that are able to
command: and ii it be lawiull Fas ot nefas to doe any thing that is beneficialk
onely Tyrants should possesse the earth; and they, striving to exceede in ty-
ranny, should each to other bee a slaughter man3 till the mightiest outliving
att, one stroke were leit tor Death, that in one ages mans lile should ende.
The brother (breecher) oi this Diabolicall Atheisme is dead, and in his life had
never the felicitie he aimed at z but as he begam in craft, lived in ieare and
ended in despaire. Quum inscrutabilia suot Dei judicia? This murderer ol
many brethern‚ had his conscience teared (secred) like Caine: this betrayer oi
him that gave his litator him, inherited the portion oi Judas: this Apostata
perished as ill asJumau ε and wilt thou, my friend, be his Discipte‘? Looke unte
by him persuaded to that libertie‚ and thou shalt finde it an infernali bondage.
1 knowe the least oi my demerits merit this miserable death; but witiull
striving against knowne truth, exceedeth al the terrors oi my soule. Defer not
(with me) till this last point ol extremitie3 ior little knowest thou how inthe
end thou shalt be visited. (Shatspere’s dilectore-Bootes, pp. 29-30.
