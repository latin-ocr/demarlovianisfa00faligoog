Carmina illa pars sunt Libelli arceto Letter of notodle
Conlocat inscripti et a Gabriele Harveio editi quum jurgio
contenderet cum Greeuo et Thoma Nash.

ι Harwey's Neroe Letter is dated September 1593, inquit Bullenns,
and Marlowe died in the June preceding. The drift of the ι goggle-
eyed sonet ol Gorgon » (as Nashe terms it) aud v L’Envoy › plainly
is, — ι Marlowe is dead; it remeius to muzzle Nashe. » The epitaph
in the v Postscript» certainly refers to Marlowe, aud the meaning
ol the extraordinary lines « l mus'd awhile, » etc, is the sameas iu
the previous sonnet. But what are we to make ol the Glosset The
only sense to be got out of the lines is that Marlowe had lalleua
victim to the plague. We know that the plagae was raging at that
time in the metropolis. Probably Gabriel Harvey was staying iu the
country, to be out of the reach of insection (His antagonist Nashe had
removed to the country in 1592, lor saiety as we learu from the
Private Epistle to the printer prefixed to the first authorised edition
of Pierce Pcailesse), when he wrote his Neroe Letter. Hearing the
repert of Marlowe's death he had taken it sor granted, when ha
raised his whoop of exultation, that the poet had died of the plague. We
may he sure that, if he had been acquainted at the time with the true
account ol Marlowa’s tragic end, he would have gloated over every
detail with ghoul-like ferocity ².

‘GonJectura eo verisimilis videtur quod Marlovius‚ quamvis

non ipse curn fratribus Harveianis jurgio contendisset, palam
tamen eos probris vexaverat, et praecipue Ricardum, natu mini-
mum, qui sacerdos erat.
