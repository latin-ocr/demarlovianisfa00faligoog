animus suus conturbatur verbis expromit, ethaeo verba
r se solerter conjungendo is qui scribit modo a vero decedit
btemperat artibus, vel potius necessitatibus scenicis, Soli-
1ii autem ratio magis veritatis speciem praebere mihi videtur
m ratio eorum qui, tragoedias scribentes, confugiunt, ut
omentum exponant, ad opem inevitabilis socii quem prae-
ra persona in consilium advocat et cui suos abditos sensus
lit. Spectaculum animi suis sensibus in hoc summo discri-
re periculi se dedentis, certe majorem habet misericordiam
erius est quam frigida verba personae rem docentis socium
rs partes plerumque in id loci redactae sunt ut responsa
cet et ea data audiat.

uisii ducis soliloquium nec fervore, nec eloquentia caret.

Gaiae. Now, Guise, begin those deep-engendered thoughts
To burst abroad those neverdying flames ,
Which cannot he extinguished but by blood.

Ost have Ι levelled, and at last have learn’d
That peril is the chiefest way to happiness

And resolution honour's fairest aim.

What glory is there in a common good,

That hangs for every peasant to achieve?

That like l best that flios beyond my reach.

Set me to scale the high Pyramides,

And thereon set the diadem of F rance;

l’ll either rond it with my nails to naught,

Or mount the top with my aspiring wingS,
Although my downsall be the deepest hell.

For this Ι wahe, when others think Ι sleep3
For this Ι wait, that scorn attendanoe else;

For this, my quenchless thirst, whereon I build,
Hath often pleaded kindred to the king;

For this this head, this heart, this hand, and swerd,
Contrives, imagines, and fully executes,
Matters of impert aimed at by many,

Yet understood by none;

For this, hath heaven engendered me of earth3
F or this, this earth sustains my body’s weight,
And with this weight l'll counterpoise a crown,
Or with seditions weary all the world;

For this, from Spain the stately Catholics

Send lndian gold to coin me Frenoh eones ,·
For this, have l a largess from tho Papo,
