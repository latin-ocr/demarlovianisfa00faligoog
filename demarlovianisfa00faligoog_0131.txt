·-tao-

Or some upreared high-aspiring swalna,

As it might be the Turhiah Tamderlaine.

Then weeneth hahis base drink·drowned.spright
Rapt to the three-sold lolt os heaven hight‚

When he conceives upon his lained stage

The stalking steps ol his greate personage,

Graced with huf-cap termes and thundring threats,
That his poore hearers' hayre quite upright sets.
Now, least such frightfull showes ol Fortune’s fall
And blondy tyrants'rage should chance apall

The dead-stroke audience, midst the silent rout
Comes leaping in a selle-missormed lout,

And laughes, and grins, and frames his mimick lace,
And justles straight into the prince's place :

Then doth the theatro eccho all aloud

Witt gladsomo noyse ol that applauding crowd :

Α goodly hoch-poch, when vile russettings
Are match [Ἠ] with monarche and with mightie Kings ¹. »

Prior tragediae pars primum sola in scenam inducta suerat.
Fabula vero praeter spem plausus excitante, posteriorem llar-
lovius scripsit. Rem ipse confirmat in hujus partis prologo ε

‹ The general walcones Tambnrlaine received, ’

When he arrived last upon the stage,

Hath made our poet'pen his Second Part,

Where death cuts off the progress os his pomp,

And murderous lates throw, all his triumphs down.
' But what became os lair Zenocrate,

And with how many cities’ sacrifice

He celebrated her sad funeral,

Himsell in presence shall unsold at large. ι

Posterior pars confestim, ut ita dicam, priorem secuta est, et
fabula tali modo expleta, tota in scenam inducta fuit per unum
et eumdem scenicum ludum. Ea ratione fabula videtur persaepe,
nisi semper, aota fuisse, Henslovius enim, qui rem interdum
notavit, in aliis locis fabulam solo vocabulo Tumdurtutae desi-
gnat, ita ut incertum sit utrum posterior nota rem in breve

cogat, an denuntiet priorem partem solam in scenam inductam
fuisse.
