in English, ι was qnick to perceive the consequent impoverishment
of rhythm. ι Surelyl can lament, 110 says, that we are fallen into ,
auch a plain and simple manner of writing that there is none other ’-
1001 used but 000. 1 Gascoigne was well aware that English prosody

rolied on accent3 and he described this 1001 01 whose tyranny he

complained, as composed s 01 two syllables, whereof 1110 first is

depressed or made short, and the second is elevate or mado long.»

He further pointed out that Chaucer had used greater liberties with
metre; ‹ and whosoever do perusa and well consider his works, he
shall find that although his lines are not always 01000 sslf-same
number 01 syllables, yet, being read by 000 that heth understanding,
the longest verse and that which harh most syllables in it with fall
to the ear correspondent unto that which heth fewest syllables in it,
and, likewise, that which 1101 10 11 lowest syllables, shall be found
yet to consist of words that have such natural sound‚ as may seem
equal in length to 0 verse which halh many more syllables of lighter
aecents. 1 ’11110 passage contained 1110 pith 01 1110 whole matter; and
010000 analysis of classic and Italian metres led poetsto thesemo
result3 namely, that what they called v the 1100001010 iambie » could
be written with far greater effect 01 melody and force 01 011010οἰ0 by
varying the unit 011110 rhythm, 001110 foot.

‹ Here, however, intervened the great difficulty 01 English scan-
sion, 00 longas that seansion was still referred to the quantitative
theory. A Greek tragic senarius consisted of six seet3 00011 1001
consisted 01 0 short syllable followed by 0 long ; but 10 0001010 010000
011110 verse, in the first, third, and fifth two longs might be used.
Thus the normal structure 011110 1100 was this.

‹Furthermore, equivalents lor both 1110 iamb and the spondeo
might be employed 01 fixed intervals3 and thus the tribrach, anapest
and dactyl were, under certain restrictions, admitted 1010 1110 verse.
Τ110 000 inadmissible 1001 was the troobee; and tho one invariable
1001 was an iamb in 1110 final place. Now, in order to imitate an
iambic lin'e upon the accentual system, it was necessary to make an
unaccented syllable pass 1000011001, and an accented syllable for a
long. According to the practice of Surrey and Sackville 1110 imita-
tive process seemed easy, so long as the versifier confined himself
to the simple 1001 01 which Gascoigne complained. He sacrificed the
native variety of the English rhythm, and did not profit by the foreign
varieties of the classical 010100. This was because he was working
upon a radically false theory. But no sooner did a poet arise who
