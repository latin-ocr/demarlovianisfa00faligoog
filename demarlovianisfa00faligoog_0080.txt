t1 The manner os the death aad lost aad os Robert Greene,
Meister ofArtea.

« After that he had pend the former discourse (then lying sore
sicke of a surfet which hee had taken with drinking) hee continued
most patient and penitent; yea, he did with teares forsake the world,
renounced swearing, and desired forgivenes of God and the worlde
for all his offences : so that during all the time of his sicknesse
(which was about a moneths space) hee was never heard to sweare‚
rave, or blaspheme the name of God as he was accustomed to do
before that time, which greatly comforted his welwillerS, to see how
mightily the grace of God did worke in him.

α He confessed himselfe that he was n‘ever heart sicke, but said
that albis paine was in his belly. And although he continually
scowred, yet still bis belly sweld, and never left swelling upward‚

mightily wronged her, and wished that hee might see lter before he
departed. Whereupon (feeling his time was but short) ltee tocke pen
and inire, and wrote her a Letter to this effect. a

Litterae quas Greenus, quum in eo esset ut excederet vita,
uxori suae misit, deinde referuntur. Sed quod vernia, nisi sen-
sibus, lenge absunt ab ejusdem epistolae scripto, quod Harveius
in libello suo inclusit, sapienter critici fecissent, si,·antequam
illi confiderent, expectassent donec illius exemplar, vel saltem
exemplum certum tenerent.

Quamvis Greenus indignum in modum libello laedatur,
necesse fuit scriptori, qui narrabat se invenisse et edere
Greeni scriptum, eum in quodam honore haberet. Caeterum non
