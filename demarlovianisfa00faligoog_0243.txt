Genesion. - l must have wauton poets, pleasant wils,
¹ Musicians, thal with touchiug ola string

May draw the plinnl king which way l please. ¹

Music aud poetry is his delight;

Theresore l’ll have Italian masks by night,

Sweet speecheS, comedies, end pleasing shows ;

And in the day, when he shall walk' abroad,

Like sylvian nymphe my peges shall be clad3

My meu, like salyrs grezing on the 10003,

Shall with their goat-feet donce the antio hey.

Sometime a lovely boy in Diau’s shepe,

With hair that gilde the waleros it glideS,

Crownels 01 pearl about his naked orme,

And iu his sportlul hands eu olive-tree,

To hide those parts which men delight lo see,

Shall bathe him in a spring; and there hard by,

One like Aetaeon peeping though the grove,

Shall hythe angry goddess be transformed

And running in the likeness 01 an hart

By yelping hounds pulled down, and seem to die;

¹Such things as these best please his maJesty ¹.
