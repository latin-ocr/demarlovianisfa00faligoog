flung theory to the winds and returned to the native liberty ol
English accentual versification, than variety was at once attained
without the sacrifice of melody, but at the seme time the laws of
classical or quantitative prosody ol the iambic had to be freely
violated. Trochees appeared iu all places but the last, and chimerical

Eruditi autem poetae qui versus non similiter desinentes e servitute
verborum similiter consonantium exuerant, illos heroicis Graecorum

Each line stood alone, formed after the same model, ending witha
strongly accented monosyllaba Marlowe varied the pauses in its ’
rhythm ; combined the structure oi succeeding verses into periods;

metre fit to be the vehicla ol Shakspere’s or os Milton's thought.
Compared with either ol those greatest poets, Marlowe, as a
versifier‚ lacks indeed variety ‘ol cadence, and palls our sense of
melodyby emphatic magniloquence. The pomp of his ‹ mighty
line » tends to monotony; nor was he quite sure in his employ-
ment of the instrument which he discovered aud divined. The linest
bursts ol metrical music in his dramas seem often the result ol

momentary inspiration rather than the studied style ola deliberate
artist ². ›
