‹ 1 am not ignorant, inquit Thomas Nash, how eloquent our
gowned age is grown os late, so that every mechanical mate
abhorreth the English he was born to, and plucks, with a solemn'
periphrasis, his nt notes srom the ink-horn : which 1 impute not so
much to the perlection os arts, as to the servile imitation os coin-
ptorions tangentibus, who contend not so seriously to excel in
action, as to embowel the clouds in a speech ol comparison; thin-
king themselves more than initiated in poet’s immortality, il they
but once get Boreas by the heard, and the heavenly Bull by the
dewlap. But herein 1 cannot so sully bequeath them to tolly, as their
idiot ort-masters, that intrude themselves to our ears as the .
alchymists of eloquence, who·(mounted on the stopa of arrogance)
think to outbrave better pens with the awettinp bombast os brogginp
blancbnerse. Indeed, it may be the engrasted overtlow ol some
kill-cow conceit, that overcloyeth their imagination with, amore
than drunken resolution, being not extemporal in the inventiones
any other means to vent their manhood‚ commits the digestion ol

’ their choleric incumbrances to the spacious volubility ol a dartmminp
docasyttabon. Amongst this kind ol men, that repoae eternity in tlte
mouth 'of a ptoyer, 1 can but engross some deep-read school-men

’ or grammariaus, who, having no more learning in their skull than
will serve to take up a commodity, nor art in their hrain than was
nourished in a sarving-man's id1eness, will take upon them to be the
ironioal censors ol all, when God and poetry doth know they are
the simplest ol all ¹. ›

Thomas Nash, versibus decemsyllabis nou similiter desinen-
tibus et praesertim iis qui tali metro utebantur alienissimus, de
illo versu perspicue meminit in hoo loco tanquam de re nuper
inventa, cujus ad opem ii confugerent qui ingenio debiliores
essent quam ut artibus superioribus viros se praeberent (betap “
aot extemporot ta tbe invention of any other means to verat

cttmbraaces to tbe spoctous volubility of a drummtop deco-
spttoboo). Praeter haec Thomas Nash, quamvis generatim vitu-
peret eos qui temporibus illis fabulas docebant, proprie tamen
et acriter notavit eosqui versus non similiter desinentes scri-
bebant, et qui, inquit ipse, stupidi artium magistri erant. Inter
hos artium magistros, unus est quem perseverantius incursat,
et sine dubio hicnon alius est atque vir de quo dixit ipse, iu
alio proaemii sui loco, Greenum compellans : ’
