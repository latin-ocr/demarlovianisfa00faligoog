‹The « 'l'aming 01 a Shrew, ι 100011 1110, 00010100 a number 01
passages that closely resemble, 00 are identical with passages in
Marlowe’s undoubted plays - particularly Tamburtnine. This 1001
01000 would make us suspect that Marlowe was not the author; 100
poeta 01 Marlowe’s class do 001 repeat themselves in this wholesale
manner. But when we 000 how maladroitly, without the slightest
regard to the context, these passages are introduced, then we may
indeed wonder that any critic could have been so insensate as to
attribute the authorship to Marlowe ¹. ι

‹ But ba this as it may, the absurdity ol attributing the piace to
Marlowe is flagrant. The author 01 The Taminp of a Shrcw was
0 genuine humourist3 and Mr Swinburne is speaking within bounds
when he calls him ‹ Ol all the preShakespeareans incomparably
the truest, the richest, the most powerful and original humourist. r

<‹ Αο l re·read this play 01100 coming straight from the study 01

Marlowe’s influence permeated so thoroughly the dramatis literature
of his day, that it is hard sometimes to distinguish between master

and pupil. When the master is writing at his best there is no
difficulty, but when his work is hasty and ill-digested‚ or has
been 1011 incompleta and has received additions from other hands,
then our perplexity is great. Iu our disgust at the brutal horrors
that crowd the peges 01 Titus Andronicus, we must beware 01
