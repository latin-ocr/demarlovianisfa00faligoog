‹ The Troublesoma Raign of King John, 1591, inquit ille 1, is an
intolerably wooden piace of work. From the first line to the· last we
find scarcely a single touch ol poetry or power. Earless and una·
bashed must be the critic who would charge Marlowa with any
complicity in the authorship ofa play that would rank low among
the worst productione of Greene or Peele. The only piace of evidence
to connect the Play with Marlowe is a passage in the Prologus ε

«Yon that with friendly grace, etc. »

ι But so far from indicating that the author of Tamburlaine had
written tha piace that was about to be presented, these lines
rather show that thevwarlike christiamwas intended to onst the
‹unfidel ι from popular favour, - that the new play was the pro-
duction of some obscure rival of Marlowe's. The fact that expres·
sions found in Tamburluine occur in tha Troubtesome Reiyn, is, in
the absence of other evidence, of no importance; for Marlowe's
play was in all men's mouths at the time, aad every bach-writer
could filch aphrase or two from the man whom they were so anxious
to supplant. lt is impossible to select from this poor spiritless chro-
nicle play adozen consecutivae lines that to a good aar would pass
as Marlowe’s »
