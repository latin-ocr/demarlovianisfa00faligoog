perswasion the good and wholesome lesson Ι had learned went quite
out of my remembrance: to that Ι fel agaiue with the Dog to my
olde vomit, aud put my wicked lile in practise, and that so throughly
as ever l did before.

α Thus although God sent his holy spirit to call mee, and though
1 heard him, yet l regarded it no longer than the present time, when
sodaiuly forsaking it, l went forward obstinately in my misse.
Neverthelesse soone after Ι married a Gentleman’s daughter of
good account, with whom Ι lived for a while: but forasmuch as she
would perswade me from my wilfull wickednes, after Ι had a child
by her, Ι cast her off, having spent up the marriage money whichl
obtained by ber.

« Then left l her at six or seven, who went into Linoolneshire‚
and l to London : where in shorte space Ι fell into favor with such
as were of honorable and good calling. But heere note, that though
Ι knew bow to get a friend, yet Ι had not the gift or reason how to
keepe afriend : sorbeo that was my dearest friend, Ι would bee
sure so to behave my selfe towards him, that he shoulde everafter
professe to bee my utter enemic, or else vowe never after to come
in my company.

ι Thus my misdemeauors (too many to be recited) caused the
most part of those so much to despise me, thatin the end Ι became
friendles, except it were in a fewe Ale-houses, who commonly lor
my inordinate expences would make much of me, until I were on
the score, far more than ever l meant to pay by twenty nobles
thick. After Ι had wholy betaken me to the penning of plaies (which
was my continuall exeroise) lwas so far from calling upon God‚
that Ι sildome thought on God‚ but tooke such delight in swearing
and blaspheming the name of God‚ that none could thinke otherwise
of mae, than that l was the child of perdition.

ι Those vanities and other trifling Pamphlets Ι penned of Love .
and vaine fantasias was my chiefest stay of living, aud for those my
vaino discourses, Ι was beloved of the more vainer sort of people‚
who beeing my continuall companions came still to my lodgiug, and
there would continue quaffing, carowsing, and surleting with me
all the day long. Sig. C k. ι
