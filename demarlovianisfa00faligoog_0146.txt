Cosr. Barbarous and bloody Tamburlaine,

Thus to deprive me ol my crown and lilet
Treaeherous and salse Theridamas

Even attho morning ol my happy state,

Searce being seated in my royal throne,

To work my downlall and untimely endi

An uncouth pain torments my grieved soul,

And death arrests the orgen ol my voice,v

Wh0‚ entering at the breach thy sword heth made,
Sacks every vein and artier ol my heart. -·
Bloody and insatiate Tamburlainel

Tamb. Thethirst os reign and sweetness os a erown
That caused the eldest son os heavenly Ops

To thrust his doting father lrom his cheir,

And place himself in the empyreal heaven,

Moved me to manage arms against thy state.
What better precedent than mighty lovel

Nature that lramed us os lour elements,

Warring within our breasts lor regimem,

Doth teaeh us all to heve espiring minds :

Our souis, whose laculties can comprehend

The wondrous architectum os the world,

And measure every wendering planet's course, '
Still climbing alter kuowledge infinite,

And always moving at the restless sphereS,

Wills us to wear ourselveS, and never rest,

Until we reach the ripest sruit os all,

That perfect bliss and sole felicity,

The sweet fruition os an earthly crown ¹.

Eodem temporis puncta, cosroes animem efflat et Tamerlanus
militum suorum ducibus rex salutetur.

Tertio actu ineunte, Tamerlanus‚ summus rerum Asiatioarum
minator, Turcis minatur, et Bajazetus qui gentis illiusSuttao
vt, exercitum parat, ut arma armis propulsetlenocrates deinde
cedit, tam tristis et animi sui motibus tam perturbate, ut
gydes, unus e regiae virginis comitibus, ah ea quaerit our sol-
:ita sit. zenocrates respondet z

Zea. hh, lise and soul, still hover in his breast
And leave my body senseless as the earth.
