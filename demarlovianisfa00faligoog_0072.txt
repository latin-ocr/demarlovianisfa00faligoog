in fronte libelli sui, Kind-Hortsllreame1 inscripti, quem in

brem, quum abhinc tres menses Greenus mortuus esset.

a About three moneths since died M. Robert Greene, leaving¹
many papers in sundry Booke sellers handS, among other his
Guonrswonru or wrr, in which a letter written to divers play-
mauors, is offensively by one or two of them taken 3 and because on
the dead they cannot be avenged, they wiliully sorge in their
coneeites a living Author: and after tossing it two and fre, no
remedy, hut it must light on me. How Ι have all the time of my
conversing in printing hindred the bitter inreying against schol-
lers‚ itheth been very well knowne; and how in that l dealt, Ι can
sufficiently proove. With neither of them that take offense was I
acquainted, and with one of them Ι care not it Ι never be : The .
other, wbome at that timel did not so much spare, as since 1 wish
lhad, for that as Ι have moderated the heate ol living writers, and
might have usde my owne discretiori (especially in such a case).
the Author beeing dead, that Ι did not, Ι am as sory as it the originali
fault had beene my fault, because my salse have soene his demeanor
no lesse civili, than he exalent in the qualitie he professes ε BesideS,
divers os worship have reported his uprightnes of dealing, which
argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writting‚ that aprooves
his Art. For the first, whose learning Ι reverence, and at the peru-
sing of Greenes Booke, stroke out what then in consciencel thought
he in some displeasure writ : or had it beene true, yet to publish it,
was intollerable : him Ι would wish to use me no worse than l deserve.
Ι had onely in the copy this share: it was il written, as sometime
Greenes hand was none of the best; licensd it must he, ere it could
bee printed, which could never be it it might not be read. To be breiie,
l writ it over; and as neare as Ι could, followed the copy; onely in
that letter l put something out, but in the whole hooke not a wor-
de in ; iorl protest it was all Greenes, not mine nor Meister Nashes,
as some unjustly have affirmed ². r
