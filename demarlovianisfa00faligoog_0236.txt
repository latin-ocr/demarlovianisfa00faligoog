’ Well might learnd Gargrbrr'dge oft-regret .
He ever there was brbd: δ,
The tree she in his mind had set
Ι Brought poison forth instead.

His lust was lawlesse as his 1116,
And brought about his death;

For, in a deadlie mortall strile,
Striving to stop the breath

01 666 who was his rivall 166,
With his owne dagges slaine,

He greand, and word spoke never moe,
Piaro'd through the eye and braine.

Thus did he comato suddaine ende
That was a l'oe to all,

And least unto himselle a friend,
And raging passion's thrall.

Had he been brought up 16 the trade
His father lollow'd still,

This exit he had never made,
Nor playde 6 part soe ill.

Take warning ye that playes doe make,
And ye that doe them act; , ,
Desist in time for Wormall's sake,
And thinke upon bis lact. '

Blaspheming Tambolin must die,
And Faustus meere his ende;
Repent, repent, or presentlie
To hell ye must discend.

What is there, in this world, 61 worth,
That we should prize it soe?
Lile is bnt trouble from our birth,
· The wise do say andknow.

Our lives, then, let us mend with speed,
Or we shall suerly rue
The end 61 everie hainous deado,
ln 1116 that shall insue.
